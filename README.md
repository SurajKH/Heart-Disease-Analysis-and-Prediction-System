# Heart-Disease-Analysis-and-Prediction-System
Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction System basically uses various machine learning models and algorithms to train the required data prersent in the datasets.

We have made use of Logistic Regression to generate a machine learning model.

Further to arrive at a better accuracy rate we have considered Decision Tree Classifier and Random forest Classifier.

We have used Hyperparameter tuning technique to obtain more accuracy for a given model.

We have Deployed our web app with the help of Streamlit library.
